# K2Documentation.Samples.WorkflowRuntime.WorkflowClientAPI
This project contains sample code that demonstrates common uses of the SourceCode.Workflow.Client.dll API to interact with K2 workflows at runtime, such as:  
* connecting to the K2 workflow server
* starting a workflow
* retrieving workflow tasks/worklist items
* completing a workflwo task/worklist item
* working with comments and attachments 

## Prerequisites
The sample code has the following dependencies: 
* .NET Assemblies (both assemblies are included with K2 client-side tools install and are also included in the project's References folder)
  * SourceCode.Workflow.Client.dll 
  * SourceCode.HostClientAPI.dll 

## Getting started
* Use these code snippets to learn how to perform common tasks with k2 workflows through the workflow client API. 
* Note that these projects may compile, but will not actually run as-is, since they are intended as sample code only. You will need to edit the code snippets to work in your environment and with your artifacts. 
* Fetch or Pull the appropriate branch of this project for your version of K2.
